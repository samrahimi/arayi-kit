A Javascript framework for exploring and characterizing the behavior of functions in the Arayi Set.  The Arayi Set is a chaotic fractal with mind-blowing implications, discovered and characterized by Melody Mustaine (github.com/arayi).  This kit allows you to visualize a very small subset of the whole - a symmetrical 2D binary tree that transforms into a probabilistic 3D *graph*  

The set behaves in ways that are simultaneously probabilistic and deterministic - it is a model that reconciles many of the seeming contradictions between quantum and classical physics and works equally well on other scales: social graphs, natural phenomena, fluid dynamics - all are chaotic systems with an infinitely diverse range of possible outcomes, yet tend towards order / reversion to the mean at the same time. 

Furthermore, the Arayi Set is compatible with theological fundamentals of any world religion: it starts with the simplest possible duality: true and false (or false and true), and maintains this balance across the system as a whole... while being completely unpredictable in it's predictability.  

Much work remains to be done in terms of characterizing the Set more precisely, across multiple scales, and to work towards a formal mathematical definition of the Arayi Set as a whole... Hopefully this (very basic, but stable) framework will inspire and enable this research.


**Installation and Execution**

- git clone https://github.com/samrahimi/arayi-kit && cd arayi-kit
- npm install
- npm start

Then browse to http://localhost:3000

Coefficients and parameters are defined in arayi-ui.js, the recursive loop is in arayi-engine.js, and there is the beginning of an equation library in expressions.js that can be used to experiment with different types of series in a clear and modular way...
